#Digital-Art-Gallery

The Digital Art Gallery Project was developed to create an online platform for artists and art lovers, where digital artwork can be showcased in a user-friendly, visually appealing virtual space. It allows artists to upload their creations, display them in a gallery format, and engage with viewers through likes, and ratings. Additionally, the platform enables users to explore various artworks, like on their favorite pieces, and provide ratings that help artists gain recognition.
